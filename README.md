# Analyze your Swedish Language Learning Materials for their CERF Level

This app allows you to input any text that you're using to learn to read Swedish (so long as you have the text/transcript or you transcribe it) to help you determine what level the material you are reading is at. 

# How is This Measured?

There are multiple metrics:
- Word count
- Unique words
- Average word length
- Sentence count
- Distribution of words by CERF level

The level determination algorithm is based on word frequency distribution.
